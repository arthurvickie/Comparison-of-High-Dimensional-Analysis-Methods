# Comparison-of-High-Dimensional-Analysis-Methods
Code used to compare high-dimensional analysis methods as applied to paired donor/recipient transplant genetics data

Directories:

-Scripts: All of the R and bash scripts used in running the simulations for comparisons

-CodeForSimulations: txt files containing the linux command line code to run the various simulations

-TIE_PowerPlot_Code: Code to produce TIE tables and Power plots for comparison of methods

Additional Files:

-Two files to combine the data from simulations, since many simulations were run in parallel and in chunks for faster run time overall
